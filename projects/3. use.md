# Bringing Paths into Scope with the use Keyword

Having to write out the paths to call functions can feel inconvenient and repetitive.
Fortunately, there’s a way to simplify this process: we can create a **shortcut** to a path with 
the `use` keyword once, and then use the shorter name everywhere else in the scope.

>> `use` reduces the verbosity of referring to items in the used path

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Adding `use` and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in the filesystem.

By adding `use crate::front_of_house::hosting` in the crate root, `hosting` is now a valid name in that scope.  
Paths brought into scope with `use` also check privacy, like any other paths.

Note that `use` only creates the shortcut for the particular scope in which the use occurs. The following code won't work:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting; // the idiomatic way (or convention) to bring a function into scope with use

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

The compiler throws a warning that the `use` is no longer used in its scope! 
To fix this problem, move the `use` within the `customer` module too, or reference the 
shortcut in the parent module with `super::hosting` within the child customer module.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // Reference the hosting module using super::
        super::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

mod customer {
    // Move the use statement inside the customer module
    use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

## Creating Idiomatic use Paths

As we mentioned, the idiomatic way to bring a function is this:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting; // the idiomatic way (or convention) to bring a function into scope with use

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

And not this:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Specifying the parent module when calling the function makes it clear that the function 
isn’t locally defined while still minimizing repetition of the full path if we have several public functions. 

On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with use, it’s idiomatic to specify the full path. 

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}
```

There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: it’s just the convention that has emerged, 
and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.

The exception to this idiom is if we’re bringing two items with the same name 
into scope with use statements, because Rust doesn’t allow that: 

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::io;

// How to bring two Result types into scope that have the same name but different parent modules and how to refer to them.

fn function1() -> fmt::Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> io::Result<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```

### Providing New Names with the as Keyword

There’s another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the same name into the same scope with `use`: 
after the path, we can specify `as` and a new local name, or *alias*, for the type.

```rust
use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```

## "Re-exporting" (or just exporting) names with pub use

When we bring a name into scope with the `use` keyword, the name available in the new scope is private for that scope.

To enable the code that calls our code to refer to that name as if it had been defined in that code’s scope, 
we can combine `pub` and `use`. This technique is called *re-exporting* because we’re bringing an item into scope 
but also making that item available for others to bring into their scope.


```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Before this change, external code would have to call the `add_to_waitlist` 
function by using the path `restaurant::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist()`. 
Now that this `pub` use has re-exported the hosting module from the root module, external code can 
now use the path `restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist()` instead.

So, with `pub use`, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different structure. 
Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on the library and programmers calling the library.

## Using external packages
Let's suppose we add the `rand` package to our project:

```console
# Cargo.toml
rand = "0.8.5"
```

Adding `rand` as a dependency in `Cargo.toml` tells Cargo to download the `rand` package and any 
dependencies from `crates.io` and make rand available to our project. `std` its an exception, it's included with Rust.

Then, to bring rand definitions into the scope of our package, we added a `use` line 
starting with the **name of the crate**, `rand`, and listed the items we wanted to bring into scope.

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
}
```

## Using Nested Paths to Clean Up Large use Lists

If we’re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module, listing each item on its own line 
can take up a lot of vertical space in our files. 

```rust
// --snip--
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
// --snip--
```

Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one line. We do this by specifying the common 
part of the path, followed by two colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that differ.

```rust
// --snip--
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
// --snip--
```

```rust
// Dont do this!
use std::io;
use std::io::Write;

// Do this instead!
use std::io::{self, Write};
```

## The Glob Operator

If we want to bring all public items defined in a path into scope, we can specify that path followed by the `*` glob operator:

```rust
use std::collections::*;
```

This use statement brings all public items defined in `std::collections`
into the current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob can make 
it harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program was defined.

```rust

pub mod parent {
  pub fn a() {}
  fn b() {}
  pub mod child {
    pub fn c() {}
  }
}
fn main() {
  use parent::{*, child as alias};

    // Inside main, what is the total number of paths that can refer to a, b, or c 
    // (not including those that use self, super, or crate)? 
    
    // 5
    // two paths to a: parent::a and a.
    // no paths to b, because it is private. 
    // three paths to c: parent::child::c, child::c, alias::c.
}
```
