# Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a `path` in the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. 
To call a function, we need to know its path.

A path can take two forms:

* An absolute path is the full path starting from a `crate root`; for code from an external crate, the absolute path begins 
with the crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the literal crate. 
* A relative path starts from the current module and uses self, super, or an identifier in the current module.

>> Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers separated by double colons **(::)**.

>> Rust preference in general is to specify absolute paths because it’s more likely we’ll want to move code definitions and item calls independently of each other.


## Path example and items scope 

Using the last example in [modules](1.%20modules.md). Say we want to call the `add_to_waitlist` function.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

// THIS CODE WON'T COMPILE IS JUST TO SHOW THE TYPES OF PATH
pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // Ok!

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // ERROR
}
```

Relative path does not compile because that module `hosting` is private. 
Remember: in Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default.

Items in a parent module can’t use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the 
items in their ancestor modules. This is because child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, 
but the child modules can see the context in which they’re defined. However, Rust does give you the option to expose 
inner parts of child modules’ code to outer ancestor modules by using the `pub` keyword to make an item public.

Lets make hosting pub:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // Ok!

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // Still not working
}
```

Adding the `pub` keyword in front of `mod hosting` makes the module public. With this change, 
if we can access `front_of_house`, we can access `hosting`. But the contents of hosting are still private.

Making the module public doesn't make its contents public. The `pub` keyword on a module only lets code in its 
ancestor modules refer to it, not access its inner code. Because modules are containers, there’s not much we can 
do by only making the module public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more of the items within the 
module public as well.

The privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as modules. So, `add_to_waitlist` must be public.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // Ok!
}
```

## Starting relative paths with super

`super` keyword allows us to reference an item that we know is in the parent module 
(the crate is considered the parent of all modules defined inside it).

```rust
fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order(); // calling deliver_order that is defined in the crate
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}
```

```rust
pub mod a {
  pub mod b {
    pub fn f() { println!("b1"); }
    pub mod c {
      pub fn f() { println!("c1"); }
    }
  }
  pub fn entry() { super::b::c::f(); }
}
pub mod b {
  pub fn f() { println!("b2"); }
  pub mod c {
    pub fn f() { println!("c2"); }
  }
}
fn main() {
  crate::a::entry(); // Output is "c2"
}
```
entry uses the path `super::b::c::f`. entry is within the module `a`, so super refers to 
the parent module of `a`, which is the `root crate`. 
Then the child `b` of the root is the outermost module `b`, whose child `c` contains a function `f` that prints "c2".


## Making Structs and Enums Public

We can also use `pub` to designate structs and enums as public, 
but there are a few details extra we must take into account.

* If we use `pub` *before* a `struct` definition, we make the struct public,
*but* the struct’s fields will still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case basis.

```rust
mod back_of_house {
    
    // This models the case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that comes with a meal, 
    // but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based on what’s in season and in stock. 
    // The available fruit changes quickly, so customers can’t choose the fruit or even see which fruit they’ll get.
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like
    meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
    println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);

    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
    // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries");
}
```

>> Structs are often useful without their fields being public, so struct fields follow the 
general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated with pub.

In contrast, if we make an `enum` public, all of its variants are then public. We only need the pub before the enum keyword.

```rust
mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}
```

>> Enums aren’t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying 
to have to annotate all enum variants with pub in every case, so the default for enum variants is to be public.
