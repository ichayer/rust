# Separating Modules into Different Files

When modules get large, you might want to move their definitions to a separate file to make the code easier to navigate.

```rust
// src/lib.rs

mod front_of_house; 

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

```rust
// src/front_of_house.rs
pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
```

The compiler knows to look in `front_of_house.rs` because it came across the 
module declaration in the crate root with the name front_of_house.

Next, we’ll extract the `hosting` module to its own file. The process is a bit different 
because hosting is a child module of `front_of_house`, not of the root module. We’ll place the file for 
`hosting` in a new directory that will be named for its ancestors in the module tree, in this case *src/front_of_house/*.

```rust
// src/front_of_house.rs
pub mod hosting;
```

Then we create a *src/front_of_house* directory and a file `hosting.rs` to contain the definitions made in the hosting module:
```rust
// src/front_of_house/hosting.rs
pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
```

If we instead put `hosting.rs` in the `src` directory, the compiler would expect the `hosting.rs` 
code to be in a hosting module declared in the crate root, and not declared as a child of the `front_of_house` module. 

>> The mod keyword declares modules, and Rust looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into that module.
