# References

```rust
 io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut input)
```

The `&` indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature, and one of Rustâ€™s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use references. 

For now, all we know is that, like variables, references are immutable by default. Hence, we will write `&mut input` rather than `&input` to make it mutable.
